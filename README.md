# JetsProject

# Description
The program will contain a series of Jets, all with different capabilities. It will display a menu to select a jet and access information about each one individually. 

# How to Run
When you start the program, you will be given a list of jets, along with their information. Choose the corresponding number with your selection. It will either list information, start an action or prompt that you input information to add a jet, or choose which jet you'd like to remove. Finally by choosing the final option, it will quit the prgram

# Technologies Used
Eclipse, Terminal, Sublime, Java

# Lessons Learned
This was a pretty challenging project for me that I'm still a bit unsure about. I'd say the biggest thing I learned is the overall concept or arrays. That was something that is necessary in making this program function correctly
